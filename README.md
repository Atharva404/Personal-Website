Atharva Gupta's Digital Portfolio Website hosted by github pages

This is my digital portfolio that encompasses my achievements and my goals. Listed on this website are my projects, an about me section, and my interests such as travelling. This responsive website was made using HMTL and CSS.

In this personal portfolio website I learned how to work with sizing and arranging elements on the website. I had to tinker with the display:grid and work on incorporating bootstrap into my website. 

Making this digital portilio allowed me to become comfortable with web development for the front end and really understand flexbox, grid element, and css properities. Additionally I bought my own domain name from namecheap.com and hosted my platform through github pages. 

In the future:
- My next steps for this project is to keep adding my projects + academic achievements as I progress through university
- add animations and more sections to the website
